###Ag Data Visualization Application

The agricultural sector nitrogen management-related research has been extensively high by experiencing a data revolution, with an increasing influx of information from diverse sources like sensors, satellites, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) imaging technologies. In this context, effective in-season nitrogen data management has become a critical factor. Here, I will introduce the "Ag Data Visualization" web application, a user-friendly and innovative tool designed to empower stakeholders in the farming sector with actionable insights, focusing on Eastern Nebraska Research and Extension Center (ENREC) fields. The application leverages cutting-edge technology, including UAVs equipped with multispectral cameras, to capture high-resolution imagery and perform advanced geospatial analysis. Through this process, shape files are generated, ensuring precise delineation of treatment areas and crop variations across the fields. One of the central analytical tools within the application is the Sufficiency Index (SI). This metric provides vegetation index-based nitrogen management data that evaluates the effectiveness of nitrogen treatments, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and nutrient management. In addition to treatment analysis, the application smoothly integrates field information with nitrogen application data and yields data into an interactive geospatial interface. These visualization capabilities allow users to identify patterns and trends across different treatment areas in real time.

The application is developed using the R Shiny software framework, offering a range of advantages for web application development integrating with R. The application design principles prioritize user accessibility and intuitive interaction with user-friendly interfaces crafted to cater to a diverse audience, including farmers, agronomics, and policymakers. The system architecture includes the server-side implementation responsible for processing data and generating output and the client-side user interfaces (UI) responsible for handling real-time data visualization with user interactions. Results and impact of the application include enhanced crop health assessment through the visualization of nitrogen application and SI maps, optimizing resource allocation, and improved yield analysis and prediction. The interface ensures that individuals from various backgrounds can make data-driven decisions with confidence by immersing themselves in the virtual representation of the ongoing activities in the field.
